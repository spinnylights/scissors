    <h1>Scissors</h1>
    <p>
    Scissors is a tool for making <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique">cut-ups</a>.

    It could be used for all sorts of things, of course, but it may prove most obviously useful to you if you are a writer. You may be looking for novel phrases to use made from your own writing, or interested in investigating the style of another writer by cutting up their work. You might want to create a new work through cutting up the work of others. For any of these purposes, you will probably want to comb through the cut-ups you generate for choice passages you can use, rather than using the raw cut-ups you produce. Along the same lines, it may be more useful to cut up a text many times over in different ways, or to cut up many texts in the context of producing a single work. Do whatever suits your purposes best, though!

    Here is an essay by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs">William Burroghs</a> on cut-ups. "Cut and rearrange the word and image in films. There is no reason to accept a second rate product when you can have the best. And the best is there for all." The technique he describes can be used below by selecting "Burroughs/Gysin".

    To use Scissors, enter the text to be cut up in the top box, pick the cut-up methods you want to use, and press the button. If you select more than one method, they will be applied in order from left to right. The methods which introduce the least alteration are towards the left, while those that introduce the most are towards the right.
